# LLM Detect Project

## Description
LLM Detect is an AI-powered essay detector that leverages cloud computing technologies to identify whether a given piece of text was likely written by a human or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with various cloud services to create a scalable, efficient, and secure application.

## Features
- AI-powered essay analysis
- User authentication and account management
- Real-time analysis and result display
- Historical result storage and retrieval
- Admin dashboard for system monitoring

## Cloud Technologies Used
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Cloud Run for serverless deployment
- Cloud SQL for database management
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Cloud Monitoring and Logging for observability
- VPC Connectors for secure networking
- Docker for containerization
